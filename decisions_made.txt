1. No support for dynamically calculated shape reshapes
2. No support for 0 dimensions
3. No support for dynamically calculated Unsqueeze axes
4. For now no support for INT8 min and max operations
5. splits is always an attribute, always static, never a runtime tensor
6. No support for slice with more than one axis
7. Resize works for this specific configuration of attributes:
        "antialias": 0,
        "coordinate_transformation_mode": "asymmetric",
        "cubic_coeff_a": -0.75, (or any this doesn't matter for mode nearest)
        "exclude_outside": 0,
        "extrapolation_value": 0.0,
        "keep_aspect_ratio_policy": "stretch",
        "mode": "nearest",
        "nearest_mode": "floor",
8. MaxPool works on the last two dimensions of a input 4D tensor N, C, H, W
9. Same with Conv and ConvTranspose
